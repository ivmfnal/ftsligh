Version 2.10 5/3/2018
=====================
Changes:
  * Added OperationTimeout to the Scanner section of the configuration. 
    It will control the timeout for "ls" command.
    Example:
    
    [Scanner]
    OperationTimeout = 30
    ...
    
  * Added RFC2617 authentication for hold/release web service methods
    Username/password pairs are cofigured under "Users" section, one "username = password" line per user, e.g.:
    
    [Users]
    bob = BobsPasswrd
    alice = _passwrd_for_Alice

    On the client side, use curl to hold/release FTS-light:
    
    curl --digest -u alice:_passwrd_for_Alice http://host.fnal.gov:8090/fts-light/WS/hold
    curl --digest -u bob:BobsPasswrd http://host.fnal.gov:8090/fts-light/WS/release

    This should work through the proxy too.
